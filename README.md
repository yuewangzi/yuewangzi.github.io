HOW the web portfolio was created, what techniques or technologies were used, what challenge were faced and how you over came them?

I used html and css , i think most biggest challenge is i need to think how to do 
the real website follow the UX mode.And i tried to do some css animation to make something funny.



WHY some design / functional choices where made, their purpose, and future implementation of the web portfolio?
Because i think such as animation function can make the whole website looks more attractful. 
And i think in future, it will become a fashion trend to mix future implementation.



WHAT you learned from creating the web portfolio?
First,i learned from the web portfolio is how to use html to make all website for about six pages.
Second, i think the most funny part is do the design for color,font and layout design.
Third, i think most difficult is to do the animation.
